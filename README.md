Stock Portfolio Robo advisor is the automatic stock portfolio construction and rebalancing software created. Using listed companies' financial statements, we constructed a portfolio based on value investment and growth investment strategy. 

Language and tools used: Python, MySQL, Machine Learning 

Concepts used: Financial Analytics, Optimization 

Dataset used: Balance sheet, Cashflow statement, income statement, and historical returns of 4000 listed stocks.

-	Automatic stock portfolio creation and rebalancing.
-	Technology used: python, Machine Learning, MySQL. 
-	Concepts used: Financial Analytics, optimization.
-	Dataset used: Ten years financial statements (Cash flow, income statement & Balance sheet) of approx. 4000 stocks listed on stock markets contribute around one million rows of data.
-	Calculating the intrinsic value of each stock.
-	Based on value investing and growth investment strategy, automatically select the undervalued stocks.
-	Using optimization, Modern Portfolio Theory, and Sharpe ratio allocate weight to the portfolio stocks.
-	Rebalancing the portfolio once a three year.
-	Portfolio risk customization and watchlist options available to consumers.
-	Using Machine learning classification, PCA, DNN algorithms and passing entire financial statements data, predict the list of stocks that may perform better than S&P500. Accuracy achieved:75%.
